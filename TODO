1. Marker size should be based on dpi 
2. Base layout on dpi and aspect-ratio
3. Map doesn't show correctly the first time
4. Move generating tid to php file (server) (needed?)
5. Don't add multiple markers on tracker side
6. Add square button to bring map back to user position and the right top corner
7. Show track on tracker side
8. Experiment with timeout, interval max time for gps fix
9. Split get_location and show_location
Far future options:
1. Make style for map - zoom buttons are too small
2. Dynamically chagne trackinf time depending on speed
3. Add option to show coordinates in settings
