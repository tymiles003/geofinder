1. Marker size should be based on dpi 
2. Base layout on dpi and aspect-ratio
4. Move generating tid to php file (server) (needed?)
5. Don't add multiple markers on tracker side
6. Add square button to bring map back to user position and the right top corner [ACTIVATE]
7. Show track on tracker side [TBTESTED]
8. Experiment with timeout, interval max time for gps fix
10. Add padding, margin and/or cenreting to all elements. Positioning based on window dimensions is not enough precise (good idea?)
11. Add "center" button and autocenter on/off button
12. sql injection check
14. Sometimes elements are way too big on firefox mobile - why?
15. Solve prefix problem when switching branches
